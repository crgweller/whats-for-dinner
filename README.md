# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
This webpage allows a user to receive randomly-generated meal ideas. They can choose to get ideas for a main dish, a side, or a dessert. Or, they can choose to be given an entire randomly selected meal comprised of all three. 

### Installation Instructions:

To install the app, open terminal, navigate to your desired directory (also known as a folder), and then enter "git clone git@github.com:crgweller/whats-for-dinner.git" and hit enter/return. Terminal will download the files and install them into your chosen directory.

### Context:

I am three weeks into Turing. I've worked on this for a total of about 12-15 hours over the past four days.

### Learning Goals:

My goal for this project was to learn how to write code from scratch in the form of functioning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: The page works and after a lot of googling and dead-end rabbit holes I was able to gain a better understanding of the process involved in creating a product like this. I think I'm starting to get a better sense of how the code works in a sort of abstract way so that I can sit back and spend some time thinking through the overall structure of the project before I start writing the code.

Challenges, I still end up in stuck in places where I puzzle over something for a long time before realizing that it's something silly like a misplaced curly bracket or capital letter. And, being in the post-covid recovery period, I've still got pretty good brain fog and my working memory is awful, so sometimes I can't remember the purpose of something I wrote half an hour ago and have to retrace my steps.
